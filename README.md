# microbetag
microbetag attempts to be a microbial interactions co-occurrence network annotator


## Docker 

The `microbetag` annotator will be available as a Docker image....

## Graphical User Interphase (GUI)


But it `microbetag` will come with a GUI too. 

A first thought on how to do this is to follow this scheme:

- build a database with the `microbetag` annotations 
- implement `microbetag` so it asks queries on the db
- output could be a list of files, some of them `.html` so they could provide interactive visualizations such as having annotations on the nodes or/and edges
